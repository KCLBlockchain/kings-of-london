                    if you want to deter other people from buying the block from you, or
                    if you are expecting the block to be bought out and want to maximise profit) < /div> <
                div > Finally, click the Buy Block button and enter submit your transaction.If you want to reduce transaction costs you can lower the gas price, this would slow down the transaction but save you Ether! < /div> <
